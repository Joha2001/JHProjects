# Java Projects
These include any projects made in the programming language, Java.
The creator of all these files are a student named John Hoang.

**Disclaimer: None of these projects should be taken and used for a student's own benefit. I do not condone cheating in any form.**

The current branch includes all projects and labs related to the course, COP 3502, Programming Fundamentals 1. 

The four projects are:

P1 - Blackjack: Plays the blackjack game, based on a randomizer (that uses a specific seed for testing purposes).\
P2 - Image RLE: Outputs images and can transcode images.
P3 - Pakudex Program: Makes a Pokedex esque system (learning classes and their intricacies).
P4 - GatorRaider: Pacman AI to try and optimize score.

The nine labs are:
L2 - Calculator (Simple 4 Function)
L3 - Scientific Calculator (Added Exponential and Log)
L4 - Numeric Conversion (Converts between hex, binary, decimal)
L5 - Connect 4 (You can choose board size!)
L6 - Cowsay (Code to help learn command line programming)
L7 - Dragon (^ Expansion on the topics from Cowsay)
L8 - Analyzer (Searching for specific strings in data using different search algorithms)
L9 - Factorial (Learning how to deal with different recursive functions)
L10 - Return of the Cow (Expansion on the topics from Cowsay + Dragon)
